# n8n-nodes-zapsign

This is an n8n community node that lets you use ZapSign's digital signature API in your n8n workflows.

[ZapSign](https://zapsign.co) is a digital signature platform that enables you to create, send, and manage legally binding electronic signatures for your documents.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
